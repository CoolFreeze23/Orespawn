# Phase G1 proof — compiled LayerDefinition to GeckoLib geo

Status: **PASS**

Ground truth is each executed, compiled `createBodyLayer()` and its baked
`ModelPart` tree. The generated side is parsed and baked by pinned GeckoLib
4.8.4, then captured through `GeoRenderer`.

The independent gates are:

- geometry: baked ModelPart world-space cube corners versus GeckoLib-rendered geo corners;
- surface mapping: position/normal/UV tuple parity through the two pinned renderer paths;
- animation: independently executed compiled `setupAnim` versus the actual fresh-baked candidate path;
  Beaver uses the owner-approved exact `Mth.cos` custom-hook legacy-parity exception;
  its emitted clip is reference-only, not runtime acceptance, and editable keyframes remain G3 work;
- visual: independent software rasterization of concrete `EntityModel.renderToBuffer` and `GeoRenderer` streams using the shipped texture.

## model_elevator (Tier 3)

- Exact bones: 5; cubes: 5.
- Geometry maximum corner delta: 0 blocks (epsilon 1e-05).
- Surface maximum UV delta: 0; normal delta: 0.
- Animation maximum rotation delta: 0 radians (epsilon 2e-06).
- Visual maximum changed fraction: 0; maximum mean absolute error: 0.

- Static identity maximum rotation motion: 0 radians; no controller emitted.

Reproduce with `gradlew.bat g1Parity`. Any mismatch exits nonzero before
proof evidence can be updated.
